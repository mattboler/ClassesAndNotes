%% Problem 3
%{
Use least squares to identify a gyroscopes scale factor (a) and bias (b). Simulate the
gyroscope using:
g(k)=ar(k) + b + n(k)
n ~ N(0, \sigma= 0.3 deg/s)
r(k) = 100sin(\omega * t)
a) perform the least squares with 10 samples (make sure to pick  so that you get one
full cycle in 10 samples.
b) Repeat part a 1000 times and calculate the mean and standard deviation of the
estimate errors (this is known as a Monte Carlo Simulation). Compare the results
to the theoretically expected mean and standard deviation
c) Repeat part (a) and (b) using 1000 samples. What does the theoretical and Monte
Carlo standard deviation of the estimated errors approach?
d) Set up the problem to run as a recursive least squares and plot the coefficients and
theoretical standard deviation of the estimate error and the actual estimate error as
a function of time.

%% Problem 4
%{
Simulate the following discrete system with a
normal random input and output noise:

G(z) = (0.25 * (z-0.8)) / (z^2 - 1.9*z + 0.95)

a) Develop the H matrix for the least squares solution.
b) Use least squares to estimate the coefficients of the above Transfer Function.
How good is the fit? Plot the bode response of the I.D. TF and the simulated TF
on the same plot. How much relative noise has been added (SNR – signal to
noise ratio), plot y and Y on the same plot.
c) Repeat the estimation process about 10 times using new values for the noise
vector each time. Compute the mean and standard deviation of your parameter
estimates. Compare the computed values of the parameter statistics with those
predicted by the theory based on the known value of the noise statistics.
d) Now use sigma between 0.1 and 1.0 and repeat parts b and c.
e) What can you

numd = 0.25*[1 -0.8];
dend = [1 -1.9 0.95];
u = randn(1000,1);
y = dlsim(numd,dend,u);
sigma = 0.01;
Y = y + sigma * randn(1000,1);

%% Problem 5
%{
Justification of white noise for certain problems. Consider two problems:
(i) Simple first order low-pass filter with bandlimited white noise as the input:

y = G(s)*w, so that S_y(jw) = |G(jw)|^2 * S_w(jw), and the noise has the
PSD
S_1(w) = {A, |w| < w_c}, {0, |w| > w_c}
G(s) = 1 / (T_w*s + 1)

(ii) The same low pass system, but with pure white noise as the input.

S_1(w) = A \forall w
G(s) = 1 / (T_w*s + 1)

The first case seems quite plausible, but the second case has an input with infinite
variance and so is not physically realizable. However, the white noise assumption
simplifies the system analysis significantly, so it is important to see if the assumption
is justified. We test this with our two examples above:
a) Sketch the noise PSD and |G(jw)| for a reasonable value of T_w and w_c to
compare the two cases.
b) Determine the S_y(jw) for the two cases. Sketch these too.
c) Determine E[y^2] for the two cases.
d) Use these results to justify the following statement:
If the input spectrum is flat considerably beyond the system bandwidth,
there is little error introduced by assuming that the input spectrum is flat
out to infinity.
